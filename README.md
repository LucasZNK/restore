## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/restore-tool.git
cd restore-tool

# Make the script executable
chmod +x restore

# Create a symbolic link to use globally
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/restore /usr/local/bin/restore
```

### Option 2: Copy to PATH

```bash
# Clone and copy to your local bin
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/restore-tool.git
cp restore-tool/restore ~/.local/bin/restore
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/restore
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage

### Creating Save Points

Save points are regular git commits with a special format:

```bash
# Create a save point
git add .
git commit -m "[SAVE #1] Initial project setup"

# Create another save point
git commit -m "[SAVE #2] Add user authentication"
```

### Restoring Save Points

Simply run `restore` in any git repository:

```bash
restore
```

This will show an interactive menu:

```

### Features in Detail

#### Preview Before Restore
When you select a save point, you'll see:
- Commit details and message
- List of changed files
- Statistics (insertions/deletions)
- Preview of actual changes (first 20 lines)

#### Safe Handling of Uncommitted Changes
If you have uncommitted changes, the tool offers options to:
1. Stash changes (recommended)
2. Discard changes
3. Cancel the operation
4. View uncommitted changes

## Save Point Convention

The tool looks for commits with the pattern `[SAVE #N]` where N is a number:

```bash
git commit -m "[SAVE #1] Description here"
git commit -m "[SAVE #42] Fixed critical bug"
```

## Requirements

- Git
- Bash 4.0 or higher
- A terminal with color support (most modern terminals)

## Tips

1. **Regular Saves**: Create save points at meaningful milestones
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, concise descriptions
3. **Number Sequentially**: While not required, sequential numbering helps track progress

## Uninstallation

To remove the tool:

```bash
# If installed with symlink
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/restore

# If copied to local bin
rm ~/.local/bin/restore
```
